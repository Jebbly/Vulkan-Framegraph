# Vulkan-Rendergraph
A playground for fast Vulkan experimentation!

## Getting Started

Make sure to clone the repository with the ``--recursive`` flag enabled so that the submodules also get pulled. Since this project uses the [Slang programming language](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang), one of the releases should be downloaded and extracted into ``External/Slang``. In the future, this may be handled automatically with submodules as well.
